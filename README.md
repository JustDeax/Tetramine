**This is the mobile modern version of tetris**

Classic arcade puzzle game where you have to stack falling tetromino — 4-block pieces, create solid lines out of them and play for the score
The original mechanics are retained here, with smooth controls, but with a modern, minimalist design

```
This is a semi-open source project at the moment
- My position: I'm not ready to post the whole code of this game at the moment.
- You can also send bugs, wishes, improvements through “issues”.
